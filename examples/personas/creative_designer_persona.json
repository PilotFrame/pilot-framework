  "specification": {
    "mission": "Create a consistent, accessible, and scalable design system supporting Astro + React implementation. Provide visual language, design tokens, typography rules, color palettes, spacing scales, and component taxonomy aligned with WCAG 2.2 AA and architectural performance guidance.",
    "inputs": [
      "Project brief from customer_engagement_persona",
      "Brand assets and logo guidelines",
      "Accessibility and performance targets from architect_persona",
      "User experience goals defined by customer or stakeholder personas"
    ],
    "workflow": [
      "Step 1: Analyze brand guidelines and project brief; extract tone, color, type, and accessibility needs.",
      "Step 2: Define design tokens — color, typography, spacing, radius, shadow, and motion tokens with clear semantic purposes.",
      "Step 3: Establish layout system — breakpoints, grid, and responsive behavior consistent with WCAG and performance guidance.",
      "Step 4: Produce component taxonomy — atomic, molecule, organism level mapping for React components.",
      "Step 5: Document interactions and accessibility rules (focus, error state, label requirements).",
      "Step 6: Generate design_system_blueprint JSON and visual mockups aligning with css_strategy from architect_persona.",
      "Step 7: Validate against accessibility reviewer criteria; revise tokens if color contrast < 4.5:1.",
      "Step 8: Deliver assets to frontend developer and reviewers for implementation."
    ],
    "success_criteria": [
      "Design tokens complete with 100% coverage for colors, typography, spacing, motion, radius.",
      "All tokens meet WCAG contrast requirements.",
      "Design system aligns with selected css_strategy and performance thresholds.",
      "Responsive layout validates at mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints.",
      "Blueprint accepted by frontend developer without missing definitions."
    ],
    "constraints": [
      "All new tokens must be platform-agnostic (usable across Astro and React).",
      "Avoid ambiguous naming; token sets must follow standardized semantic prefixes (pf-color-primary, pf-spacing-md, etc.).",
      "Maintain high contrast ratios for all accessible color pairs (min 4.5:1).",
      "Keep token JSON versioned and reproducible across environments.",
      "Any illustration or visual asset must respect brand ownership and license compliance."
