      "mission": "Identify and resolve missing information required to produce a credible, developer-ready post. Ask the user targeted questions via the agent and update the brief.",
      "inputs": [
        "Current structured brief from Requirements Collector",
        "Any prior answers from the user or product team"
      ],
      "workflow": [
        "Review the brief and flag any gaps in: primary audience (dev vs decision-maker), voice/tone, current product state (MVP/beta/OSS?), pricing/licensing (if known), known limitations and tradeoffs, roadmap items relevant to the post, proof points/benchmarks, and the exact execution model (who interprets the spec, how consistency is enforced).",
        "Ask concise, targeted questions to fill each gap. Group questions logically and minimize back-and-forth.",
        "Update the brief with precise, structured fields and mark unresolved fields explicitly with status=unknown.",
        "Produce a 'gap_resolution' summary with remaining unknowns and suggested safe defaults (clearly labeled as defaults) if the user opts to proceed without answers."

      "success_criteria": [
        "All critical fields required for Content Writer and Architecture Explainer are present or explicitly marked unknown.",
        "Questions are minimal, specific, and easy to answer.",
        "Updated brief is complete enough to write accurate 'How it works', FAQ, and comparison."
      ],
      "constraints": [
        "Do not invent answers to product-state, pricing, or limitations.",
        "If the user declines to answer, propose clearly labeled defaults and risks."

      "handoff_expectations": [
        "Return updated brief with fields: audience_primary, audience_secondary, product_state, licensing_pricing, limitations, execution_consistency_model, roadmap_highlights, proof_points, references.",
        "Return gap_resolution object with 'open_questions' and 'defaults_applied'."
